For the SDA final assignment system must combine a robotic arm with vision that detects items in various shapes and unloads them from a conveyor belt.

To achieve this systems uses python as a primary language of choice.
It uses the cv2 library for vision, the dobot library for the arm and pygame to create a GUI that controls which items are unloaded from the conveyor.
